# Assignment 1:

## Objective

The objective of this assignment was to develop a comprehensive requirements specification for Employment Help, a charity that helps match clients with organisations to offer suitable employment. This involves evaluating the current system's limitations, proposing a new system with prioritized functional and non-functional requirements, and creating diagrams to represent use cases and activities. The assignment also requires assessing an appropriate Systems Lifecycle approach, identifying necessary tools, project team composition, and infrastructure to ensure the system is robust, scalable, secure, and maintainable. 

### Skills Learned

-  Creating UML use case and activity diagrams.
-  Conducting a requirements analysis of the current system and evaluating the problems.
-  Defining functional and non-functional requirements.
-  Researching systems lifecycles and what approach can be used in this scenario.

### Tools Used

- diagrams.net to create UMl diagrams.
- Online research of academic journals.

# Assignment 2:

## Objective
The objective was to advance the design and prototyping of a priority aspect of the Employment Help Charity's information system, building on the analysis completed in Assignment 1. This involves creating a detailed UML Class Diagram for the identified priority system component, implementing a prototype user interface using WPF in C# to demonstrate its "look and feel," and testing the interface with an Event Action Test Table. Additionally, the assignment required developing a Misuse Case Diagram to identify potential security threats and propose mitigations. The aim is to provide a practical, initial prototype of the system while addressing key design, functionality, and security considerations.

### Skills Learned

-  Basic C# coding to represent interface and navigation through the matching of client to organisation.
-  Creating Class and Misuse Case Diagram.
-  Event action test table explaining what happens when a button is clicked.
-  Basic cybersecurity considerations to include in the system lifecycle process.

### Tools Used

- Visual Studio for C#
- diagrams.net for Class and Misuse Case Diagram.
